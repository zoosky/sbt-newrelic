Installation
------------
Add the following to your `project/plugins.sbt` file:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.gilt.sbt" % "sbt-newrelic" % "0.0.3")
```

Configuration
-------------
The following represents the minimum amount of code required in a `build.sbt` to use [sbt-newrelic](https://github.com/gilt/gilt-sbt-newrelic)

To use the NewRelic settings in your project, add `NewRelic.packagerSettings` to your build. If you are manually adding sbt-native-packager
archetypes, you should add this line after the archetype has set default values for settings.

```scala
NewRelic.packagerSettings
```

To use a specific New Relic Java Agent version, add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
newrelicVersion := "3.10.0"
```

To add a New Relic license key to the generated `newrelic.yml` file, add the following to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
newrelicLicenseKey := Some("1234567890abcdef")
```

An alternative approach is to pass the license key to your application via the `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable.

To provide a static `newrelic.yml` file instead of a generated file, place the
file somewhere (e.g. `resourceDirectory`, which is `conf/` by default for Play
applications, or `src/main/resources` for many other builds), and refer to it
from your build like this:

```scala
newrelicConfig := (resourceDirectory in Compile).value / "newrelic.yml"
```

The application name reported to New Relic may be modified by setting `newrelicAppName`, the default value is the name of the project.

```scala
newrelicAppName := "My Application"
```
